# This script will be executed before the execution of an export state in the Prism State Manager.
# You can use this file to define project specific actions, like cleaning up your scene or preparing objects for export.

# Example:
# print "Prism is going to export objects now."

# If the main function exists in this script, it will be called.
# The "args" argument is a dictionary with usefull information about Prism and the current export.

# def main(args):
# 	print args["prismCore"].projectName
# 	print args["scenefile"]
# 	print args["startFrame"]
# 	print args["endFrame"]
# 	print args["outputName"]
